                <p>My name is Ruth-Ann Armstrong, and I am a graduate student at Stanford from Jamaica studying artificial intelligence at Stanford University. I'm interested in using technology as a tool for supporting 
                    marginalized communities globally through my work. My technical
                     interests include natural language processing, blockchain technology and mobile development.
